Questions:

1. Not all questions have an answer yet, how do I scrape conditionally?

2. When I select "both" (to display all questions) I only get the newest ones, not a mix. How do I change this?

3. When I run ./sack-overflow it takes a solid 20 seconds before my program starts, I think this is because right now the program scrapes details for ALL questions, is there a way to change so that it only scrapes details for the question user wishes to know more about?
